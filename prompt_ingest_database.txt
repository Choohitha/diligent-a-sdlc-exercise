PROMPT: Ingest Data into SQLite Database

Create a Python script that ingests the CSV files from the 'data' directory into a SQLite database.

Requirements:
1. Create a SQLite database named 'ecommerce.db'
2. Create tables with appropriate schema matching the CSV structure:
   - customers (customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, address, city, state, zip_code, registration_date)
   - products (product_id, product_name, category, price, stock_quantity, description, supplier_id)
   - orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount, status, shipping_address)
   - order_items (order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price, subtotal)
   - suppliers (supplier_id, supplier_name, contact_email, phone, address, city, state)

3. Define appropriate data types for each column:
   - IDs: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
   - Names, addresses, text: TEXT
   - Prices, amounts: REAL   - Dates: TEXT or DATE
   - Quantities: INTEGER

4. Read each CSV file and insert the data into the corresponding table
5. Handle any data type conversions needed
6. Add foreign key constraints where appropriate
7. Display progress messages showing how many records were inserted per table
8. Handle errors gracefully (file not found, data type mismatches, etc.)

The script should be named 'ingest_data.py' and should work with the CSV files generated by the data generation script.
